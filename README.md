# Epistemic Robotics

A research-oriented robotics framework combining:

- ROS 2 (C++)
- Epistemic SLAM
- Multi-agent epistemic planning
- Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL)
- Formal semantics in Lean 4

Lean is used for specification and verification of epistemic updates.
ROS 2 nodes implement real-time inference and planning.
